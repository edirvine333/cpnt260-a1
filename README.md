## NOTES  

1. The page was designed for a mock electrical contractor.
2. The page is not responsive.  I reached a point where I want to keep what I have done as reference rather than make a mess of it by changing things.
3. I have included in the HTML comments a To Do list of things that could be done to improve the page and a Flaws list of things that I'm not sure how to fix.
